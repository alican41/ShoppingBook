# Shopping Book üõíüõçÔ∏è

Shopping Book is a modern, visually-driven Android application designed to help users manage their shopping lists effectively. Developed entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for adding, viewing, and deleting shopping items, complete with photographic references.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Intuitive Item Listing:** A clean and scrollable list displays all saved shopping items, making it easy to quickly browse your inventory.
-   **Comprehensive Item Management:**
    -   **Add New Item:** Effortlessly add new shopping entries by providing the item name, the store where it can be found, its price, and a relevant image.
    -   **Detailed View:** Access a dedicated screen to view all information about a selected item, presented in a structured and elegant card layout.
    -   **Delete Item:** Easily remove items from your list via the detail screen when they are no longer needed.
-   **Advanced Image Handling:**
    -   **Flexible Image Source:** Choose to attach an image either by selecting an existing photo from your device's **Gallery** or by capturing a new one directly using the **Camera**.
    -   **Smart Permission Management:** Implements robust runtime permission requests for `CAMERA` and storage access (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` for Android 13+ or `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` for older versions), ensuring a smooth user onboarding experience.
    -   **Automatic EXIF Correction:** A crucial feature that reads **EXIF metadata** from newly captured camera photos. This intelligently corrects common orientation issues, guaranteeing that images are always displayed upright regardless of how the photo was taken.
-   **Local Data Persistence:** All shopping items and their associated data are securely stored on the device using a **Room Database**, ensuring data availability even without an internet connection.

## üöÄ Technologies & Architecture

The "Shopping Book" app is built upon a solid foundation of modern Android development tools and best practices.

* **Language:** 100% **Kotlin** ‚Äì Leveraging its conciseness, safety, and modern features.
* **UI Toolkit:** **Jetpack Compose** ‚Äì Declarative UI for building beautiful and responsive interfaces.
* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** ‚Äì Provides a clear separation of concerns, enhances testability, and improves maintainability of the codebase.
* **Navigation:** **Jetpack Navigation for Compose** ‚Äì Manages in-app screen transitions and argument passing within a single-activity setup.
* **Database:** **Room Persistence Library** ‚Äì An abstraction layer over SQLite, offering robust and efficient local data storage.
* **Asynchronicity:** **Kotlin Coroutines** ‚Äì Used for managing background operations (e.g., database transactions, image processing) efficiently without blocking the main thread.
* **Image Loading:** **Coil (Image Loading Library for Android)** ‚Äì A fast and lightweight image loading library specifically designed for Kotlin coroutines and Compose.
* **Image Handling Utilities:**
    * `ActivityResultContracts`: For streamlined handling of activity results, such as picking images or taking photos.
    * `FileProvider`: Securely shares content files between apps.
    * `ExifInterface`: For reading and manipulating EXIF data in JPEG images to correct orientation.
